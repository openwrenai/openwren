## Completed Phases
### Phase 1 — Project Setup + Core Agent (no messaging yet)
### Phase 2 — Telegram Channel
### Phase 3 — Multi-Agent Routing
### Phase 3.1 — Session Refactor + User System + Timestamps
### Phase 3.2 — Externalize User Config (JSON5 + Dot-Notation)
### Phase 3.5 — Rebrand to Open Wren
### Phase 3.6 — Channel Decoupling (Bindings Pattern)
### Phase 3.7 — Per-Agent Provider/Model with Cascading Fallbacks
### Phase 3.7.1 — Timestamp Date Fix
### Phase 3.8 — Discord Channel
**Manual setup required before running:** Enable "Message Content Intent" in Discord Developer Portal → App → Bot → Privileged Gateway Intents.
Add Discord as a second messaging channel. Each bot hardwired to one agent — no prefix routing. DMs only.
### Phase 3.8.1 — Remove Prefix Routing
### Phase 4 — WebSocket Gateway
### Phase 5 — CLI Commands
### Phase 6 — Installer / npm Packaging
### Phase 6.1 — README v1
### Phase 6.2 — Switch to ES Modules (via tsup bundler)
### Phase 7 — Ollama Support
### Phase 8 — Skills System
### Phase 9 — Web Research (Search + Fetch + Browser)
Add web research tools: search, fetch, and browser. Search uses a provider abstraction (like LLM providers) so backends are swappable via config. Fetch and browser are standalone tools.
### Phase 9.1 — Cron / Scheduled Tasks + Heartbeat
### Phase 9.2 — Shell Security & Confirmation System
### Phase 9.3 — Agent Orchestration: Teams, Delegations & Multi-Level Hierarchy
### Phase 9.4 — Session Refactor
### Phase 9.5 — AI SDK Provider Integration
### Phase 9.6 — Token Tracking
### Phase 9.7 — Prompt Caching (Anthropic)

### Phase 10 — Web UI (Dashboard)

A local browser dashboard at `http://127.0.0.1:3000`. Opened via `openwren dashboard` (opens browser). The existing Fastify gateway serves the built SPA as static files and handles all backend communication — REST API for data operations, WebSocket for chat.

**Tech stack:** React 19 + TypeScript + Vite + Tailwind CSS + shadcn/ui (Radix primitives). React 19 compiler handles memoization automatically — no `useMemo`/`useCallback` needed. shadcn components are copy-pasted into the project (not an npm dependency) — you own the code, full customization.

**Project structure:** `webui/` at the top level with its own `package.json`, separate from the Node.js backend. Clean separation — frontend and backend only communicate via WebSocket and REST API. Never import backend code from frontend or vice versa. This structure also allows wrapping in Electron or Tauri later for a native desktop app (`.dmg`, `.exe`) without any rewrite.

**Step 1 — Scaffolding**
**Step 2 — Dashboard**
**Step 3.0 — Chat & Sessions (two-mode layout)**
**Step 3.1 — Session Architecture Refactor**
**Step 4.0 — Agent Page: Dropdown, Tabs & File Editor**
**Step 4.1 — Agent Config Editing, Creation & Deletion**
**Step 4.2 — Cron Jobs Tab (Agent Page)**
**Step 4.3 — Skills Tab (Agent Page)**
**Step 4.4 — Channels Tab (Agent Page)**
**Step 5.0 — Teams**
**Step 6.0 — Config**
**Step 6.1 — Derive roles from teams, hide tool permissions from users**

**Step 7 — Schedules (uses Phase 9.1 REST API)**
- [ ] Cron job list — view all scheduled tasks, last run time, next run time (GET /api/schedules)
- [ ] Enable/disable/run-now controls per job (POST /api/schedules/:id/enable|disable|run)
- [ ] Create/edit/delete scheduled jobs via form UI
- [ ] Run history viewer per job
- [ ] Heartbeat checklist editor (edit heartbeat.md per agent)

Agent Pause now and let user review progress so far...

**Step 8 — Usage**
- [ ] Period selector — Today, 7d, 30d, All (sums from summary.json days, no extra API call)
- [ ] Summary cards — total input, output, cached tokens, estimated cost
- [ ] Daily breakdown — horizontal bar chart (cached vs uncached), from summary.json.days
- [ ] By Agent / By Provider / By Source — sorted lists with token counts and percentages
- [ ] Drill-down table — click any bar/row to see per-request entries (GET /api/usage/detail)
- [ ] Cost estimation — per-model pricing (from @llmgateway/models or config map)
- [ ] Auto-refresh every 60 seconds

Agent Pause now and let user review progress so far...

**Step 9 — Memory**
- [ ] Memory file browser — list all files in `~/.openwren/memory/`
- [ ] Memory editor — view and edit individual memory files (markdown)
- [ ] Memory delete — remove stale memory keys

Agent Pause now and let user review progress so far...

**Step 10 — Skills**
- [ ] Skills panel — list all loaded skills, which are active vs gated out, enable/disable toggle

Agent Pause now and let user review progress so far...

**Step 11 — Workflows**
- [ ] Workflow list — active and completed workflows with status badge, manager, started date
- [ ] Status filter — All, Running, Completed, Failed
- [ ] Workflow detail — task tree view showing parent-child hierarchy, status per task, duration, assigned agent
- [ ] Task detail — click a task node to see full info: agent, assigned by, status, duration, result summary, deliverables, error
- [ ] Real-time updates — active workflow task statuses update via WebSocket events (task_completed, task_failed)

Agent Pause now and let user review progress so far...

**Step 12 — Logs**
- [ ] Live log tail — stream `~/.openwren/openwren.log` with text filter

Agent Pause now and let user review progress so far...

**Step 13 — Approvals**
- [ ] Approval panel — view pending shell command confirmations and approve/reject from browser
- [ ] Allowlist editor — view and edit `exec-approvals.json` (permanently approved commands per agent)

Agent Pause now and let user review progress so far...

### Phase 11 — WhatsApp (Optional, Proceed with Caution)

WhatsApp support via `@whiskeysockets/baileys`. Unofficial, reverse-engineers WhatsApp Web protocol.

**Risks:** violates WhatsApp ToS (ban possible), can break on protocol updates, supply chain risk — only ever install `@whiskeysockets/baileys`, never forks. A malicious clone was caught stealing session tokens in late 2025.

- [ ] `src/channels/whatsapp.ts` — Baileys socket setup, QR code auth, message routing
- [ ] Persistent auth state (scan QR once, stays logged in)
- [ ] Reconnection logic (Baileys drops connection occasionally)
- [ ] Wire into `channels/index.ts` alongside Telegram and Discord

### Phase 12 — Polish + Deployment

- [ ] **Pre-compaction memory flush** — before compacting, run a silent agent turn to save critical context to memory files
- [ ] **Semantic memory search** — upgrade from keyword matching to vector embeddings so "auth bug" matches "authentication issues"
- [ ] Logging and usage tracking (token counts, cost per message)
- [ ] Docker + `docker-compose` for VPS deployment
- [ ] **File access sandbox review** — consider configurable `allowedPaths` so agent can access directories outside workspace without full shell access
- [ ] **Shell path hardening** — validate that shell command arguments resolve inside the workspace before execution. Currently cwd is set to `~/.openwren/` but agents can escape via absolute paths (`ls /etc`) or relative paths (`cat ../../`). Needs per-command path argument validation.
- [ ] **Shell command whitelist review** — make whitelist configurable via `openwren.json` so users can add/remove commands without touching code
- [ ] **`reloadEnv()` / `reloadConfig()`** — hot-reload `.env` and `openwren.json` without restart. Needed when agents can self-modify (install skills, add API keys). Keep env data in a refreshable module-level map so reload is a one-function change
- [ ] **Exact token tracking** — replace character ÷ 4 estimates with exact input/output token counts from Anthropic API `usage` field in responses. Apply to session compaction estimates, run history logging, and future usage dashboard
- [ ] **Hierarchy graph visualization** — replace nested cards on Teams → Hierarchy tab with interactive graph using `react-organizational-chart` (or React Flow). Nodes are clickable React components (open agent detail modal on click). Tree structure data already built via `buildHierarchy()` in Teams.tsx.
